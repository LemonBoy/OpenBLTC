BLTC PROTOCOL

Screw you Freescale, we have haxx!
===================================

Every command is padded to 0x10 boundary.

== Upload to ram ==

First it comes the handshake, wich is 0x20 bytes long (basically are two
commands sent together). The payload must be in .sb format.

0x00 - 0x01            - init upload command
0x01 - 'B' 'L' 'T' 'C' - protocol signature
0x05 - 0x01            - version or sub-command
0x09 - depends         - payload size (BE)
0x11 - 0x2             - start upload command
0x12 - depends         - payload size, again

After the handshake the payload is sent in chunks 0x41 bytes wise.

0x01 - 0x2             - start upload command
0x02 - chunk (0x40b)   - payload chunk
